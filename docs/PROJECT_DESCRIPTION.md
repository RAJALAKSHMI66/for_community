- Unknown wait times leading to overcrowding at certain facilities
- Language barriers preventing access to critical health services
- Confusion about which facilities offer specific services

#### 2. Mental Health Crisis
- Social isolation causing increased anxiety and depression
- Limited access to mental health professionals
- Stigma preventing people from seeking help
- Lack of tools for self-monitoring emotional wellbeing

#### 3. Information Chaos
- Rapid spread of misinformation on social media
- Difficulty distinguishing official guidance from rumors
- Information overload causing decision paralysis
- Critical updates not reaching vulnerable populations

#### 4. Community Fragmentation
- Elderly and vulnerable individuals unable to access basic necessities
- Willing volunteers unable to find those who need help
- Lack of organized systems for mutual aid
